# 🔘 z-index: Like stickers on glass sheets

![z-index analogy](/images/z-index.jpg)

## `z-index` is like putting stickers on glass sheets. Whichever one’s higher in the stack, wins.

> - **Tech Definition (simple):**  
`z-index` is a CSS property that controls the vertical stacking order of elements that overlap.  
Higher `z-index` = closer to the front. Only works on elements with `position` set (e.g., `relative`, `absolute`, etc.).

## 💡 Why this analogy helps

When I was starting with CSS, I kept wondering why some things wouldn’t show up — turns out they were “underneath” other stuff!  
Thinking of stickers helped me realize: it's not about code order, it's about stacking context.
