# Can‚Äôt Do Yet, But Trying 
![Can‚Äôt Do Yet, But Trying Banner](/images/cant-do-yet-but-trying-banner.jpg)
**Collection of frontend concepts, explained like metaphors you'd actually remember.**

## My personal learning series
Here I take HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other frontend development concepts and **explain them with quirky, simple analogies.**  
I‚Äôm not a pro *yet*, but I‚Äôm trying ‚Äî and maybe that‚Äôs enough to help someone else learn too.

## üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Natalia

Former AR Creator turning into a frontend developer.  
I started this series because technical docs made me cry a little, and visual metaphors helped things finally *click*. So I‚Äôm **sharing what helps me** ‚Äî honestly, imperfectly, and with a lot of **fun analogies**.
