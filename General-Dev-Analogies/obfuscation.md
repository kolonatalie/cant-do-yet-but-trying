# üîò Obfuscation: Like cutting a puzzle into random shapes

![obfuscation analogy](/images/obfuscation.jpg)

## Obfuscation is like taking a finished puzzle, then cutting each piece into random shapes. It‚Äôs still the same image‚Ä¶ somewhere.

> - **Tech Definition (simple):**  
**Obfuscation** is the process of deliberately making source code difficult to understand.  
It doesn‚Äôt change what the code *does* ‚Äî only how readable (or unreadable) it is.  
Used in JavaScript and other languages to protect code from being copied or reverse-engineered.

## üí° Why this analogy helps

When I first saw obfuscated JavaScript, it looked like someone had spilled alphabet soup into the codebase. The "puzzle" idea helped: it *was* a normal program once, but now the variables are renamed, the logic is split, and everything looks chaotic on purpose. The image is still there ‚Äî just hidden behind the noise.
